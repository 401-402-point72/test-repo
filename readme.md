# Read Me
## This is a repo to mess around with git
Try and make some commits and then make some pull requests.
## Aliases
The `/aliases` folder has some useful git and rust aliases that I use that I think everyone might find helpful.

To use these copy the file or specific alias you want. Paste the file somewhere such as your home directory, or if you already have an alias file, paste the function in there. 

Add this to your `~/.bashrc` file:
```sh
source /path/to/your/alias/file
```
Easily open bashrc using `vim ~/.bashrc`.

You can either restart your console or run `source ~/.bashrc` to have the aliases work.
